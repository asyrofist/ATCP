NAME
    TODO Things to do in the Automatic Thesaurus Construction Package

SYNOPSIS
    Automatic Thesaurus Construction Package Todo list

DESCRIPTION
    The following list describes some of the features that we'd like to
    include in ATCP in future. No particular priority is assigned to these
    items - they are all things we've discussed amongst ourselves or with
    users and agree would be good to add.

    If you have additional ideas, or would like to comment on something on
    the current list, please let us know via the ngram mailing list.

  VERIFY THESAURUS CONSTRUCTION
    What should change if the user wants to re-build the thesaurus, but
    changing only the number of related terms. It should not be necessary
    to rebuild the whole thesaurus, having the middle files.
